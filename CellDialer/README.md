# Audio and Serial Communication with SIMCOM SIM7600G-H Modem

This project contains C# classes designed to manage audio streaming and serial communication with the SIMCOM SIM7600G-H modem. The modem is typically used in embedded systems or IoT devices for telecommunication and audio data processing.

## Overview

The code in this project is split into three main classes, each handling a different aspect of audio processing and serial communication:

1. **`AudioDeviceManager`**: Lists available audio devices and their input/output channel capabilities.
2. **`AudioStreamer`**: Captures audio input and plays it back through an output device in real-time (loopback).
3. **`SerialAudioPhone`**: Manages serial communication with the SIMCOM SIM7600G-H modem, handling AT commands and audio streaming for phone calls.

## Key Features

- **Audio Device Management**: Easily list and select audio devices for further processing.
- **Real-Time Audio Loopback**: Test audio input and output devices using real-time streaming with adjustable sample rate and channels.
- **SIMCOM SIM7600G-H Modem Integration**: Send AT commands and transmit/receive audio data over serial communication with support for automated call handling.

## Hardware Requirements

This project is designed for use with the **SIMCOM SIM7600G-H** modem. It assumes you have two serial interfaces configured for the modem:
- One serial interface for AT command communication.
- One serial interface for audio data transmission.

## Software Requirements

- **NAudio Library**: This project uses the NAudio library for handling audio device management and streaming in C#. You can install it via NuGet:
  ```bash
  dotnet add package NAudio
  ```
- **System.IO.Ports Library**: You'll also need to import the System.IO.Ports library to avoid an invalid reference error to the .NET Framework version of this library with the same name.
  ```bash
  dotnet add package System.IO.Ports
  ```

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following classes:

### `AudioDeviceManager`

This class allows you to list and inspect all active audio devices on your system. It displays the device index, input channels, output channels, and the device name.

#### Usage Example:
```csharp
var manager = new AudioDeviceManager();
manager.ListDevices();
```

### `AudioStreamer`

The `AudioStreamer` class captures audio input from a specified device and plays it back in real-time through another device. This is useful for testing audio loopback scenarios.

#### Usage Example:
```csharp
var streamer = new AudioStreamer(inputDeviceIndex: 1, outputDeviceIndex: 0);
streamer.Start();

// Press any key to stop the streaming
Console.ReadKey();
streamer.Stop();
```

### `SerialAudioPhone`

The `SerialAudioPhone` class is designed specifically for working with the SIMCOM SIM7600G-H modem. It handles sending AT commands, initiating calls, and streaming audio through the modemâ€™s audio serial port. The call continues until the user presses the "Esc" key or the call ends due to a "NO CARRIER" response from the modem.

#### Usage Example:
```csharp
var phone = new SerialAudioPhone("COM3", "COM4");
phone.StartCall("10086");
```

### Important Notes:
- The critical AT command `AT+CPCMREG=1` is sent right after dialing the phone number to ensure that audio transmission is enabled on the modem.
- You can end the call manually by pressing the "Esc" key.
